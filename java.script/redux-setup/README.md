# Redux Setup

This project is a basic setup for managing state in a JavaScript application using Redux. It includes the necessary files and configurations to get started with Redux and React.

## Project Structure

```
redux-setup
├── src
│   ├── index.js          # Entry point of the application
│   ├── store
│   │   ├── actions.js    # Action creators for Redux
│   │   ├── reducers.js    # Root reducer combining multiple reducers
│   │   └── store.js       # Configures and creates the Redux store
├── package.json           # npm configuration file
└── README.md              # Project documentation
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd redux-setup
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the application:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

2. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the application in action.

## Redux Overview

- **Actions**: Functions that return action objects. They describe what happened in the application.
- **Reducers**: Pure functions that take the current state and an action, and return a new state.
- **Store**: The single source of truth that holds the application state.

## Example

You can create actions in `src/store/actions.js`, define how the state changes in `src/store/reducers.js`, and configure the store in `src/store/store.js`. The `src/index.js` file initializes the Redux store and connects it to the React application using the `Provider` component from `react-redux`.
